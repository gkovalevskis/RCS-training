				Authors who publish books without a publisher; 
				Filmmakers who reach their viewers or developers who realize their ideas through Amazon. 
				Amazon partners can concentrate on the essentials: 
				their products, their content, their innovations.

				<br />
				<p>Our own journey started in 2009, when we launched the Zibbet Marketplace. 
				Our mission was the same as it is today – to help creative entrepreneurs sell more. 
				Over the years, as we witnessed new marketplaces popping up, it became clear to us that if we were 
				to really achieve our mission we had to give sellers an easy way to take advantage of this changing 
				industry. With the ability to sell everywhere and manage everything from one place, sellers are able 
				to get their products in front of more customers and have the best chance of success.
