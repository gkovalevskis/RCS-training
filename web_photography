			<h2>Light your shoot</h2>
			<p>
			Good lighting is key to good photography. It makes it easier for shoppers to accurately see the details and colors of your products. 
			When lighting your products, the key is to avoid harsh light, whether it’s direct sunlight, 
			a strong fluorescent indoor bulb or a flash on your camera. Don't have lighting equipment? 
			Sunlight makes for beautiful photos, if you diffuse the light. To avoid harsh shadows, use indirect sunlight. If you’re shooting outdoors, 
			wait for a cloudy day. Harsh sunlight can create unwanted shadows. You can also avoid harsh direct sunlight by shooting in the partial shade 
			and outside the hours when the sun is brightest. When taking photographs indoors using natural light, try positioning your products a 
			few feet from a window, and aim for a time of day when light is plentiful but not shining directly on your product (overly bright light 
			can cause details to get washed out). If the light is still too bright, try hanging a thin white bedsheet over the window to diffuse the 
			light and create a soft glow.

			<h2>Steady your shoot</h2>
			<p>
			It’s crucial for product photographs to be in focus, because clear product shots give shoppers 
			more confidence to make a purchase. Use these tips to get sharp shots.
			Taking clear photos of your products requires a steady camera. If you hold the camera with your hands, 
			it’s likely that you will slightly move the camera while photographing, and your photos will come out blurry. 
			Stabilize your camera by placing it on a tripod or solid surface, such as a sturdy stack of books. 
			Any hard surface will provide stability, but a tripod will give you more leverage to adjust your camera angle.
